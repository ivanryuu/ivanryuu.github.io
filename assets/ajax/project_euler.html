			<h4>Project Euler Problems Solved</h4>
			<p>
				Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
				 insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming 
				 skills will be required to solve most problems.

				I have successfully solved 38 problems from different difficulties and different topics that required me to learn something new.
