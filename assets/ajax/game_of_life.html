			<h4>Game Of Life</h4>
			<p>
				Conway's Game of Life attempts to simulate a system that can build copies of itself based on certain survival rules. The game itself is a zero-player game,
				which refers to programs that use artificial intelligence rather than human players, meaning that the evolution is determined by the initial state, until 
				an equilibrium is reached in which no more cells are being generated or destroyed.
			</br>
				Game of Life is an infinite universe made up of a grid squares that represent cells. Each of these cells can only be either alive or dead. Each of these cells 
				interacts with its immediate neighbors and based on that, it means the difference between life and death.
